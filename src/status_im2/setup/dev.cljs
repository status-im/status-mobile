;; @walletconnect/jsonrpc-utils/dist/esm/error.js parseConnectionError() method
;; 2. "Cannot read property 'message' of undefined": same as 1, but for Android
;; 3. "InternalError Metro has encountered an error": an error that happens when losing connection to metro, can be safely ignored
;; 4. "undefined Unable to resolve module `parse-svg-path`": an error that happens when losing connection to metro, can be safely ignored
;; 5. "group12": referring to the group-icon size 12x12. Currently, it is not available. When the design team adds it to the
;; icon set it will be added to project.
