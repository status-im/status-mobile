(defn call
  "Call private RPC endpoint.

  method: string - The name of an endpoint function in status-go, with the first
  character lowercased and prefixed by wakuext_. For example, the BackupData
  function should be represented as the string wakuext_backupData.

  params: sequence - A positional sequence of zero or more arguments.

  on-success/on-error: function/vector (optional) - When a function, it will be
  called with the transformed response as the sole argument. When a vector, it
  is expected to be a valid re-frame event vector, and the event will be
  dispatched with the transformed response conj'ed at the end.

  js-response: boolean - When non-nil, the successful response will not be
  recursively converted to Clojure data structures. Default: nil.

  number-of-retries: integer - The maximum number of retries in case of failure.
  Default: nil.

  delay: integer - The number of milliseconds to wait between retries. Default:
  nil.

  Note that on-error is optional, but if not provided, a default implementation
  will be used.
