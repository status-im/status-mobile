;;;; React Native Testing Library

(defn- with-node-or-screen
  "Wrap RN Testing Library `method-name` and call it either on a ReactTestInstance
  or directly on the screen object.

  `method-name` can be either the name of the native method, or a kebab case
  keyword.

  It is often necessary in REPL sessions to call methods on the returned
  instance of RNTL `render` method, otherwise you can get weird errors, like
  'Unable to find node on an unmounted component'. This happens because RNTL was
  mainly conceptualized to run inside a test runner that automatically cleans up
  everything after each test.

  Usage:
  (def get-by-text (wrap-screen-or-node :get-by-text))

  In another file, and with the REPL running with the Shadow-CLJS `:mobile`
  target:

    (comment
      ;; Consider using a shorter var name when playing in a REPL.
      (def component (h/render [quo/counter {} 50]))
      (h/get-by-text component \"50\")

      ;; Or without the node it works too, but it is only reliable inside
      ;; a test runner.
      (h/get-by-text \"50\"))
