(defn test-async
  "Runs `f` inside `cljs.test/async` macro in a restorable re-frame checkpoint.

  `f` will be called with one argument, the `done` function exposed by the
  `cljs.test/async` macro. Normally, you don't need to use `done`, but you can
  call it if you want to early-terminate the current test, so that the test
  runner can execute the next one.

  Option `fail-fast?`, when truthy (defaults to true), will force the test
  runner to terminate on any test failure. Setting it to false can be useful
  during development when you want the rest of the test suite to run due to a
  flaky test. Prefer to fail fast in the CI to save on time & resources.

  When `fail-fast?` is falsey, re-frame's state is automatically restored after
  a test failure, so that the next integration test can run from a pristine
  state.

  Option `timeout-ms` controls the total time allowed to run `f`. The value
  should be high enough to account for some variability, otherwise the test may
  fail more often.
