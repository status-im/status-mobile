## Preamble

    Idea: <to be assigned>
    Title: <title>
    Status: <Draft | In Progress | Closed >
    Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
    Requires (*optional): <Idea number(s)>
    Replaces (*optional): <Idea number(s)>

## Summary

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide
> a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the Idea.

## Swarm Participants

> Here all roles in swarm are defined and filled, one of the contributors should
> responsibility of the Idea as Lead.
>
> Lead Contributor is the Owner of the Idea. If required, they can get support
> from a PM, but should be responsible for end to end execution of the Idea.
> This includes ensuring appropriate resources are allocated, setting realistic
> timelines and milestones, and any post-launch metrics or bug fixes that are
> attributed to the Idea
>
> A swarm requires at minimum 3 contributors. For user-facing swarms
> PM/UX(R)/Eng functions have to be present.
>
> For swarms lead by core contributors, swarm lead is evaluator by default.
>
> 'Contributor' should be replaced with a descriptive role type.

### Requirements & Dependencies

> Are there bugs or feature requests in other repositories that are part of this
> Idea?

### Security and Privacy Implications

> If the security and privacy implications of the idea are non-trivial,
> elaborate on the problem space and a plan for resolving it here.

## Dates

> Description of deliverables at a given date, for example each Town Hall (default).
> Add more iterations as required.
>
> Evaluator accepts responsbility to checkin at Goal dates, forces discussion to
> continue implementation or recommend disband and post-mortem.
>
> Upcoming Town Halls this quarter:
> 2018-04-23, 2018-05-07, 2018-05-21, 2018-06-04, 2018-06-18
