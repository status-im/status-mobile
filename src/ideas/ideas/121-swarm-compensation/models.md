A list of potential models to explore in experiments as part of this swarm

# Bountify All

## Problem

We have a lot of issues in various Status repositories. These could to a large
extent be solved by the larger community, as well as incentivized according to
priority by core contributors.

Additionally, there's no reward for putting bounties on issues, which leads to
an uphill battle in terms of bounty growth (see Andy's slides Town Hall).

## Solution

Create a swarm that will put a bounty on all outstanding issues and give
bountifier/issue creator a reward (finder's fee) for doing so, assuming the
issue gets solved.

The finder's fee can be ad hoc in inital implementation, and if proven
successful it can be encoded in a SOB contract.

There are five objections for putting a bounty on all issues as far as I
can see:

1. **Issue is not well-defined enough**

    Then it should be closed.

2. **Issue requires privileged access**

    OK exception - mark with label 'closed-flow' and move on.

3. **Cost**

    Currently we have around 500 issues in status-react. Assuming they are all good
    issues, and they get rewarded an average of $100 _if solved_, that's $50k. This
    isn't an unreasonable amount, assuming we actually solve these issues.

    Additionally, we can put an artificial growth limit on this. So first week 20 issues,
    next week 22, etc.

4. **Perverse incentives**

    This is only true for core contributors, and we aren't currently operating in a
    byzantine environment. So this can be solved simply by a basic honor system, and
    simple soft rules like not solving bounties you yourself put up.

5. **Effort involved**

    The finder's fee of 10% (or 5% for issue creator 5% for bounty creator)
    hopefully solves this issue. This is the hypothesis this swarm would test.

## Future work

1. Automatically put bounties on all new issues, given some conditions

2. Instead of spitballing bounty size, use issue size and priority to determine
   bounty size. E.g. a matrix where bounty size can be 1\*3=3 (small, high prio),
   3\*3=9 (big, high prio).


# Grant & Burn

1. A user can request funds for a certain time interval, e.g. SNT10.000 for the next 30 days.
   - Usually this request will be tied to a specific proposed project/piece
     of work but that should be treated as implementation detail.
2. Other people "Supporters" can pay into this contract until the threshold is reached
3. After 30 days all supporters can either do
   - A) Nothing, their stake will be paid out to the requesting user in full after 10 more days.
   - B) Burn half their stake and receive back the other half.

Burning half the money is a big statement and people won't do that
lightly â€” it's useful to flag bad actors though. The more usual case
would be just not working with the user again (which is an acceptable
outcome that should not have negative consequences for either side).

Allowing supporters to delegate the burning decision to someone else
could be interesting in making this work for swarms as well. Swarm
lead could be delegate for other people on the team while the swarm
lead still remains accountable to original supporters. This might
create a weird dynamic when the swarm lead doesn't get his chunk
though.
