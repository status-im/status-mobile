# User Story 5: Subscribe to Moderation Providers

## Description

*User A* discovers a bad quality of her feed regarding advertisement and
unwanted phrases. She heard about *Moderator A* providing a service for
better feed quality. She subscribes to *Muderator A* and her feed improves
by the rules of the moderator.

## Trigger

*User A* wants an improvement of her feed quality.

## Actors

- *User A*
- *Moderator A*

## Pre-Condition

The feed of *User A* is unfiltered, filtered by own rules or filtered
by rules of other moderators.

## Post-Condition

The feed of *User A* is filtered like before plus by the rules of
*Moderator A*.

## Flow

- *User A* opens a global menu and selects the menu point for subbscribing
  to moderators.
- A dialog containing list of all so far subscribed moderators plus a field
  for entering a new one appears.
- *User A* enters the address of *Moderator A*.
- The address will be added to the moderator list of *User A*.

## Remarks

- Question: Are filters here and in the other user stories only subtractive
  or can they also be a kind of valuing (+/- value)? So I can say the phrase
  "Status" is for me +5 opposite to a moderators -2. This way I can create
  some adjustment.
- Discussion: Does the order of subscribed moderators influence the result?
- Todo: Add user stories for the manipulation of the moderator list.
