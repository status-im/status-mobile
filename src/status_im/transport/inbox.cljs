;; How does offline inboxing work ?
;;
;; - We send a request to the mailserver, we are only interested in the
;; messages since `last-request`, the time of the last successful request,
;; and the last 24 hours for topics that were just joined
;; - The mailserver doesn't directly respond to the request and
;; instead we start receiving messages in the filters for the requested
;; topics.
;; - These messages are expired that is how we differentiate them from
;; normal whisper messages to update last-received
;; - After fetching-timeout is reached since the last mailserver message
;; was received without a connection incident, we consider the request
;; successfull and update `last-request` and `fetch-history?` fields of each
;; topic to false
;; - If the mailserver was not ready when we tried for instance to request
;; the history of a topic after joining a chat, the request will be done
;; as soon as the mailserver becomes available
