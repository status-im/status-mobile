  We cannot sort them by :timestamp, as that represents the clock of the sender

  We naively and arbitrarly group them assuming that out-of-order timestamps
  fall in the previous bucket.
  A sends M1 to B with timestamp 2000-01-01T00:00:00
  B replies M2 with timestamp    1999-12-31-23:59:59
  M1 needs to be displayed before M2
