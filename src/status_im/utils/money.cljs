;; The BigNumber version included in web3 sometimes hangs when dividing large
;; numbers Hence we want to use these functions instead of fromWei etc, which
;; come bundled with web3. See
;; https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/issues/120 for this regression being
;; introduced in some JS environments. It is fixed in the MikeMcl/bignumber.js
;; repo, but not in the web3 BigNumber fork:
;; https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/877
;;
;; Additionally, while it is possible to use the BigNumber constructor without
;; stringifying the number, this only works up to some 15 significant digits:
;; https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/issues/120
;;
;; Lastly, notice the bad rounding for native Javascript numbers above 17 digits
;; that may result in errors earlier up the call chain. Ideally all money-related
;; sensitive functions should be moved into this namespace to check for such
;; matters:

;;NOTE(goranjovic) - We have two basic representations of values that refer to cryptocurrency amounts:
;;formatted and
;; internal. Formatted representation is the one we show on screens and include in reports, whereas
;; internal
;; representation is the one that we pass on to ethereum network for execution, transfer, etc.
;; The difference between the two depends on the number of decimals, i.e. internal representation is
;; expressed in terms
;; of a whole number of smallest divisible parts of the formatted value.
;;
;; E.g. for Ether, it's smallest part is wei or 10^(-18) of 1 ether
;; for arbitrary ERC20 token the smallest part is 10^(-decimals) of 1 token
;;
;; Different tokens can have different number of allowed decimals, so it's neccessary to include the
;; decimals parameter
;; to get the amount scale right.
