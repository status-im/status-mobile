  "Takes a map of co-effects and forms as argument.

  The next forms are functions applying effects and returning a map of effects.
  The fn ensures that updates to db are passed from function to function within the cofx :db key and
  that only a :merging-fx-with-common-keys effect is returned if some functions are trying
  to produce the same effects (excepted :db, :data-source/tx and :data-source/base-tx effects).
  :data-source/tx and :data-source/base-tx effects are handled specially and their results
  (list of transactions) are compacted to one transactions list (for each effect). "
