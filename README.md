# Status - a Mobile Ethereum Operating System

Join us in creating a browser, messenger, and gateway to a decentralized world. Status is a free (libre) open source mobile client targeting Android & iOS built entirely on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) technologies. That's right, no middle men and `go-ethereum` running directly on your device.

## Why?

We believe in a medium of pure free trade, economies with fair, permission-less access and a world without intermediaries. We want to create policies that can exist between friends or scale globally, we want to communicate securely and be uninhibited by legacy systems.   

We want to take responsibility for our data, the way we conduct ourselves privately and promote this way of life to a mass audience.

We want deep insights into our own economies so we can make informed, data-driven decisions on how to make our lives better. The Ethereum blockchain, Smart Contracts, Swarm and Whisper provides us a path forward.  

If this interests you, **help us make Status a reality** - anyone can contribute and we need everyone at any skill level to participate.

## How to Contribute?

Go straight to the [wiki](https://wiki.status.im) or [join our Slack](http://slack.status.im) and [Riot](http://chat.status.im) or choose what interests you:

- **Developer**
Developers are the heart of software and to keep Status beating we need all the help we can get! If you're looking to code in ClojureScript or Golang then Status is the project for you! We use React Native and there is even some Java/Objective-C too!  
Want to learn more about it? Start by reading our [Developer Introduction](https://wiki.status.im/Developer_Documentation) which guides you through the technology stack and start browsing [beginner issues](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20). Then you can read how to [Build Status](https://wiki.status.im/Building_Status), which talks about managing project dependencies, coding guidelines and testing procedures.

- **Community Management**  
Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system - without community Status is meaningless. We're looking to create a positive, fun environment to explore new ideas, experiment and grow the Status community. Building a community takes a lot of work but the people you'll meet and long lasting relationships you form will be well worth it, check out our [Community Development Guide](https://wiki.status.im/Main_Page#Our_community)

- **Specification / Documentation**  
John Dewey once said "Education is not preparation for life; education is life *itself* ". Developers & Designers need guidance and it all starts from documentation and specifications. Our software is only as good as its documentation, head over to our [wiki](https://wiki.status.im) and see how you can improve what we have.

- **Blog Writing**  
Content is King, keeping our blog up to date and informing the community of news helps keep everyone on the same page. [Jump on our Slack](http://slack.status.im) and discuss with Carl how you can contribute.

- **Marketing**  
In this day and age attention is limited, we need all the help we can get to find people who are interested in Status, whether that is paid user acquisition, public relations or hype building, check out our [Getting Involved Guide](https://wiki.status.im/Getting_Involved) to see how you can spread the word.

- **Testers**  
It's bug hunting season! Status is currently in Alpha and there are sure to be a bunch of education, [grab your fresh copy of Status](https://wiki.status.im/Developer_Documentation#Building_Status) and shake your phone to submit bug reports, or start browsing our [Github Issues](http://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues). Every bug you find brings Status closer to stable, usable software for everyone to enjoy!

- **Security**  
Status is a visual interface to make permanent changes on the Blockchain, it handles crypto-tokens that have real value and allows 3rd party code execution. Security is paramount to its success. You are given permission to break Status as hard as you can, as long as you share your findings with the community!

- **Design & User Experience**  
It's all about that sex appeal, we want cryptocurrencies to be easy and fun to use, ugly software doesn't help adoption. [Check out our designs](https://wiki.status.im/Design_Guidelines) and show us how to make them better!

- **Evangelism**  
Help us spread the word! Tell a friend *right now*, in fact tell **everyone** - yell from a mountain if you have to, every person counts!
