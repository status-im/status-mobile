Several users have reported an issue in upgrading from release 1.6.1 to release 1.7. This update fixes the issue.

#### Full
Several users have reported an issue in upgrading from release 1.6.1 to release 1.7. This update fixes the issue.

The issue occurs when the application is killed during a migration that is part of the update. Killing the app causes the migration to fail and leaves a persistent database error. This error prevents users from unlocking their profile; Showing an error on password entry. The fix provided above resolves this issue by restarting the migration. It also prevents the issue from occuring if you haven’t updated yet.

So far we’ve only received reports on this issue occurring on Android. We’re monitoring closely to see if further action is required and will take action to prevent this issue from occuring in future updates. Many thanks to our ambassador tbenr and others who reported this issue.

#### Fixed
Retry failed migration

## 1.4 - Keycard, notifications DRAFT
In version 1.4, Status introduces a much anticipated integration with Keycard - the secure, contactless hardware wallet, also designed and developed by The Status Network. This integration enables Keycard holders to store their private keys offline on the Keycard device, add hardware-enforced authorizations to all of their transactions, and introduce two-factor authentication to log into their Status account. 

Another highly anticipated feature is the introduction of notifications. These notifications are [ANDRE to add detail]....

The final addition to v1.4 is the introduction of  browser support for EIP 1139 – A JavaScript Ethereum Provider API for consistency across clients and applications.

Beyond that, version 1.4 includes some updates to the FAQ, extended translation support, and some fixes to ENS username displays, dark mode contrast, QR code scanner and more. 

For the full changelog, see our [Github](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/commits/release/1.4.x).

#### Added
- Keycard integration on Android
- Browser support for eip-1193 (?)
- Notifications (Android)
- Content type for images in preparation of 'Images in chat' release

#### Changed
- Extended and consolidated FAQ
- Extended translation support 
- Animation in header (Profile + Wallet)


#### Fixed
- ENS in chat only when transaction is confirmed
- Dark mode contrast (increased)
- Updated and expanded token icons
- Resolved error on scrolling account view
- Parse markdown in subheader chat list
- Banner to back up seed phrase tappable
- [Chat performance improvements](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/10711)
- QR code scanning issue when scanning from join.status.im


## 1.3 - Dark Mode, Group Chat

In version 1.3, Status catches up to the most important design trend in recent history with the introduction of a dark mode.

Hyperbolic? Perhaps, but we've heard your requests and we made it happen. Your app's appearance will now default to match your system settings, but if you'd like, you can head to `Profile` > `Appearance` to override it. Dark mode sure is easy on the eyes.

Beyond that, we're bringing back private groups, another highly requested feature. Private groups allow you to add up to 9 friends to an invite-only chat. At the protocol level, group chats in Status function similarly to 1:1 chats. They're encrypted end-to-end and utilise perfect forward secrecy to protect your privacy. 

In the future, we'd like to expand these to host more than 10 members. We'll embark on further testing to determine the upper limit that our current protocol can support.  

Lastly, we've changed our webview implementation over to the react-native-community package, to remain in sync with the React Native community and benefit from upstream improvements.

As always, we've also included a few nice fixes in this release. For the full changelog, [see our Github](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/commits/release/1.3.x). 


#### Added
- Dark mode
- Group chat

#### Changed
- Browser implementation now using react-native-community webview package

#### Fixed
- Updates to back navigation
- Persistant wallet value
- Update to all text input, increasing pressable areas
- Improved seed phrase text input on small screens
- Easier to find user's public key for sharing (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/10207#event-3163431514)
- Shortened universal links (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/10083)

## 1.2

### Short Version

The change log is small, but significant! We've enabled mailservers that use our forked version of Whisper, known as Waku. Waku servers reduces bandwidth consumption by the app and enable Status to serve more concurrent users.

A few bug fixes and optimizations are included, too.

### Blog Post

This release is one of the most important in Status' history. The change log is small, but significant. Today we're rolling out new mailservers that use our fork of the Whisper messaging protocol, known as Waku. 

Waku mailservers prevent Status from using excessive mobile bandwidth. With Waku, Status can support 10 times as many users as with Whisper servers alone.

Regular Whisper mailservers use topic-based filters to surface only the chats that you want to see, but your device still receives all messages sent over the network. Filtration happens after the fact. 

To save on resources, Waku mailservers simply tell other nodes in the network which topics your device would like to receive content for, filtering before the messages reach your device.

Heavy message traffic can be incredibly resource intensive, depending on how many topics you follow. For a heavy user, the difference can amount to several hundred kilobytes of data per minute. 

There is a potential privacy tradeoff in making your followed topics apparent to other nodes—it is easier to know if a given IP address belongs to a certain chat. 

In v1.2, we offer the legacy Whisper servers as an option under `Advanced` settings. You can disable Waku by toggling `Waku enabled`. Waku mailservers talk to existing mailservers without any disruption. 

With further improvements to Waku in the pipeline, Status becomes accessible to even more users and can deliver peer-to-peer messaging without draining unnecessary data. 



### Changelog

#### Changed
- Waku mailservers 
- Updating wallet fiat prices even more frequently (awaiting clarification)

#### Fixed
- App crashing when webview is closed
- Messages not showing when received while on a different tab
- Token balances displayed as 0 after relogin

## 1.0

### Blog Post

Status version 1 is live!  

After nearly a year of quiet and focused development, we've restructured the core application, built out the promises of the white paper and prepared the app for a future in which the Status Network seeks to deliver on the promises of Ethereum at large.

While the core mobile application is no longer the sole focus of the Status Network, it is integral to our dream of a decentralized web. With Status, we're building not just a tool for private and secure communication, but a gateway into an emerging ecosystem of distributed applications that embodies what is possible with decentralized technologies today. We believe apps like Status represent the future of the web—enabling an internet that can uphold human rights, and providing a path towards more open and equitable systems.

Today, the underpinninngs of the core application are still tethered to the Ethereum stack. Whisper is still the communication layer of Status, and Status is still the only production use case of Whisper.

The scalability of Whisper is not significantly improved from what it was roughly three years ago, when we first embarked on this project. We face immense challenge in building on this stack every day.

But we also feel ready to share our progress with the world. Status version 1 launches with the Ethereum wallet, web3-enabled browser and peer-to-peer messenger that our community knows well. It includes new SNT utility features, like a sticker marketplace and a decentralized DApp directory (https://dap.ps). Other white paper features, such as the fiat-to-crypto Teller Network and incentivized messaging with Tribute to Talk, are well underway.

Most pressingly, we're working to remedy the limitations of Whisper. In a forthcoming release, we'll introduce Waku mailservers, which will reduce the amount of bandwidth Status consumes—an important point for accessibility—and extend the capabilities of our nodes so that Status can support more concurrent users.

> Names and picture have changed as we use a different algorithm to generate it (linear > > feedback shift register instead of Mersienne Twister).
> There are breaking changing between protocol, as agreed before, so no compatibility at all. Previous version won't be able to receive/send messages to v1.

> We confirmed the performance improvement with the test-team, roughly 45% improvement in how quickly chats load (maybe greater).
>indeed, true, good move to make together.

## 0.13.2
- V1 notification
- Bug fixes:
    - Neverending loading indicator (#8550)
    - Last message jumps after chat is opened (#8556)
- Sticker Market with two packs launched on mainnet
- Account explorer in preparation for multi-account
- Onboarding face lift (preparing for multiaccount/keycard)

## 0.13.0

This release comes with a long change log and one popularly requested new feature: custom, user-added ERC20 token support. 

If you'd like to see a token that the Status wallet does not display by default, you can now add it yourself. From the wallet screen, open `Manage Assets` from the `...` menu and select `Add custom token`. Fill in the token's contract address, and the relevant information, and you will then be able to view this asset in your wallet. 

We've also added and altered our privacy settings:

1) New `Preview privacy mode`: toggling this option in your profile will ensure that Status displays a blank screen when switching apps on your phone, to protect you from accidentally exposing your information while doing other things. Thanks to contributor [bitsikka](https://github.com/bitsikka) for this feature!
2) `Browser privacy mode` has been relocated from the profile to the browser, and reconfigured into a two option setting. Selecting `Require my permission` for this setting ensures that privacy mode is on, but still means that some DApps may be incompatible with Status.

![](https://notes.status.im/uploads/upload_c9ea844cdcdc1ce5a786373ac08521bc.png)

There are a few more important changes:

- `Fetch more messages` was introduced in 0.12.0 to fill gaps in your message history; it now backfills gaps of up to 30 days in public chats, increased from 24 hours.
- We've removed the swipe functionality from the chat screen. To remove a chat, you can now tap on it and hold, pulling up a bottom menu. Another shout out to [bitsikka](https://github.com/bitsikka) for this change!
- We've reintroduced bug reporting on both iOS and Android: shake your phone to pull up an email report, or enable `Development mode` from your profile screen to `Report a bug` from there.

Lastly, we've had some great contributions from the community for this release. They've added new features, refactored and even merged some changes to our developer tools.

Special thanks to [tbenr](https://github.com/tbenr), [bitsikka](https://github.com/bitsikka), [m0ar](https://github.com/m0ar) and [alexanmtz](https://github.com/alexanmtz) for your recent [commits](https://notes.status.im/CgruSsRzQVGhsagaLxXGqQ?view#0130-mobile-release)!

## 0.12.0

In this release, we're announcing the launch of Discover!

Discover is our new portal for exploring the decentralized web. It has long been our vision for Status to act as a gateway to the new web, just like Chrome or Safari do for web2.

Until this point, however, we've prioritized a curated list of DApps over an open-ended experience. 

With the launch of Discover, our browser becomes just that—a browser, with special capabilities for web3.

Discover is its own web app and the new go-to for finding DApps. For now, we've ported over our existing list, with a few upgrades to the UI.

But in the near future, we're decentralizing Discover, enabling anyone to add a DApp and giving the community control over curation through an SNT voting mechanism. More on that [here](https://our.status.im/discover-preparing-for-launch/).

Discover can be accessed from any browser at https://dap.ps, so you can participate on desktop as well.

This release also comes with a noteworthy chat improvement. Previously, a gap in connection to the mail servers—which happens if Status is closed for more than 24 hours or otherwise loses connection—meant that some messages might be lost.

We now detect gaps where messages are missing and offer you the option to fetch the missing history. By tapping `Fetch messages` when it appears within a chat, you can backfill missing history. This is a big step forward for reliability in our peer-to-peer service.

**Added**
- `Fetch messages` option to get missing message history
- Discover is live on https://dap.ps

**Changed**
- `DApps` screen is now fully browser-centric with address bar, history and a link to Discover 


**Fixed** 
- Contact syncing between 0.11.0 and newer builds
- 503 error when accessing DApps
- More reliable history for token transactions

## 0.11.0

Download 0.11.0 and you'll notice one thing right away: we have a new navigation!

The home screen has been split into two tabs: Chats & DApps. From the chat view, you'll find the option to start or join a new chat has moved from the top right corner to bottom center.

The DApp list also looks slightly different. We've done away with info screens for each DApp. Once you navigate to a URL, you'll find that your browser history appears under a `Recent` section at the top.

This is phase one of bigger improvements to come, so we'd love to hear your feedback.

We've also made preparations for the impending [Chaos Unicorn Day](https://chaos-unicorn-day.org/) in this release. 

Reminder: On April 1st, we'll experiment with eliminating all centralized, third party services from Status, including our own node clusters. To safeguard from the chaos, we've prepared [a guide for you](https://our.status.im/bulletproofing-against-chaos-unicorns-with-status-on-arm/).  



**Added** 
- New DApps added 
- New extensions features integrated within Status
- Chaos mode and preparation for Chaos Unicorn Day

**Changed**
- New bottom navigation: chats & DApps are separated
- Improved UI performance (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/164245989)

**Fixed** 
- Universal link to public chat bug (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/7549)
- Beta warning popup (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/7771)
- DApp offline error (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/7188#issuecomment-474308724)
- Bug with QR code scanner for custom bootnodes (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/7782)
- Error message when entering an incorrect custom mailserver (https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/7752)


## 0.10.1 - Hot Fix

**Added** 
- Option for automatic mail server selection to optimize connection

**Fixed**
- Copy errors corrected
- "Fetching messages" indicator appears on home screen

## 0.10.0

A handful of exciting new features and fixes coming to you fresh in 0.10.0.

First, a word about our new version numbers. Until now, our build versions have followed a convention of minor increments: 0.9.31, 0.9.32, 0.9.33. To better reflect the scope of our releases, we've [decided to level up](https://discuss.status.im/t/new-status-versioning-scheme/1066) to 0.10.0 and increment by 0.1.0 for typical releases, and 0.0.N for bug fixes. Our routine is business as usual otherwise.

Onto the highlights from 0.10.0.

The option to block a user will come in handy for those who participate in popular public chats. If someone is spamming a chat or otherwise bugging you, simply tap on their icon and hit `Block contact` from their profile. You'll no longer see any of their messages.

From _your_ profile screen, you can undo this action via a new contact list feature. Open  `Contacts` to find a list of users who are able to see your info—namely, photo and display name—and from there, `Blocked users` to see and unblock users as you wish.

To better find users you _do_ want to hear from, we've added a search bar to the home screen. This allows you to filter through chats and browser history items. Text search within a chat is still to come.

Back on your profile screen, you'll find another helpful new option to control message syncing. If on a mobile network, you can require Status to ask before syncing conversations, in order to protect against heavy data usage. You can also enable mobile network syncing by default, or turn these options off completely. 

You'll also find a new DApp permissions section here. DApps that adhere to browser privacy mode [ask permission](https://our.status.im/0-9-33/) to access your Ethereum account. You can now revoke access for a given DApp using these settings.

And that concludes the most significant changes of this release! For more, check out the change log below.

**Added**
- Ability to block specific users from profile view
- Contacts and blocked users list
- Search bar for chats and browser history 
- Option to turn off syncing for chat on cell connection 
- DApp web3 permissions management 
- New DApps and WBTC token

**Changed**
- Push notifications include sender name
- Contact updates pushed periodically to better maintain user data
- Public chats show first letter instead of #
- Minor tweaks to chat UI

**Fixed**
- Status now works on restricted [ports](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/pull/7382)
- Overlap on small screens during log-in
- False mailserver connection error [removed](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/7531)
- Premature sending of contact requests on Profile > Send message
- DApps on same host (i.e. IPFS) no longer share user-granted permissions

## 0.9.33

We're back in action! After a pause for the holidays and a transition back that saw us release 4 small updates to v.0.9.32, we've got a brand new mobile version for you.

This release is a big one.

First, we've made significant improvements to log-in, yielding a 10x increase in log-in speed. Android users will also be pleased to find a "Save password until logout" toggle to match iOS. This will save you significant time on launch of the app.

Push notifications are improved by a number of fixes, including opening to the appropriate chat and no longer exposing your language settings to recipients using a different language than your own.

Because of these fixes, anyone using an older version of the app **_will not receive notifications_** from users on v.0.9.33. Furthermore, iOS users will not receive push notifications while the app is closed, nor if they are on certain iOS versions (11.X). This is a known and temporary issue.

Browser privacy mode is now enabled by default. This means that DApps will be required to ask permission before connecting to your wallet, and it may cause some DApps to break. If you find a DApp isn't working, you can go to your profile screen and toggle privacy mode off. In many cases, this should fix the issue. 

We're hopeful that more and more DApp developers will be up to speed with this new convention soon. 

Device pairing is no longer hidden under development mode. Visit the device section on your profile screen to "Pair this device" and sync messages and contacts from your phone to desktop. You can also name your devices to track which you've paired.

For the full list of changes, see below.

**Added**
- Device pairing and naming
- "Save password until logout" for Android
- New DApps including Aragon and Dragonereum 
- BUFF token for ETHDenver
- Titles and favicons in browser
- Support for EIP1577, multihash interface for ENS names

**Changed**
- Privacy mode enabled by default
- Log-in time improved 10x
- Private group chats limited to 10 members
- Connectivity loading indicator no longer appears as "Fetching messages"
- Chat bubble width increased
- Ethereum provider consistent with EIP1193
- Upgraded styling for group chats

**Fixed**
- Metadata leakage of language settings in push notifications
- Push notifications failing to open chat
- Loading indicator in browser
- Results displaying properly in Etheroll
- Issues with extensions installation
- Wrong password handling

## 0.9.32
Introducing beta support for Private group chats! 
In this release you’ll find the ability to start private group chats with your friends.

[All changes](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/compare/release/0.9.31...release/0.9.32)

## 0.9.31

Version 0.9.31 brings Status up to speed with the latest privacy standard for Ethereum browsers, introduced by EIP1102. 

You'll find a new privacy setting on your profile screen called "Browser privacy mode."

If you toggle this setting ON, DApps will be required to ask your permission before accessing your Status wallet. DApps that do not currently follow this standard may not work!

If you run into trouble, you can always toggle this setting OFF. With Browser privacy mode OFF, DApps can access your Status wallet without your permission. 

We're encouraging DApp builders to adopt this new standard and make web3 safer for users as soon as possible. Check the Status blog for details on how to comply.



Added
- Browser privacy mode to toggle new web3 security setting on or off
- New DApps: Crypto Takeovers, Cryptographics, blockimmo and SNT Voting DApp
