Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives you the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of DApps from your Android device.

<b>Important:</b> Status is currently in beta testing. There are risks associated with testing a beta product, so when opting in you will be prompted to read and acknowledge you understand and accept these risks.

Though still a work in progress, we hope this beta shows the beginnings of a friendly, intuitive experience for Ethereum, and what will be hopefully the start of a fantastic client for the Ethereum network.

<b>What is Status?</b>
It’s a new kind of tool, for a new kind of Internet. Browse, chat and transact, all within one app. 

We want to see a world in which people have more control over the value they create, curate and contribute to as part of larger networks. To achieve this, we build tools that make it easier to participate in, and benefit from, new kinds of human interactions and economic activity.

<b>Beta Features:</b>

■ Light Client — Status runs a full implementation of Go Ethereum, with the light client and Whisper protocols enabled.

■ Encrypted Messaging — built on top of the Whisper protocol, enabling decentralized one-on-one, group chats, and social payments.

■ Browse DApps — Seamlessly interact with the emerging ecosystem of DApps using Status' Web 3.0 browser.

■ Ether Wallet — a 'default' wallet, to provide ETH storage, send/receive transaction, a QR reader, and transaction logs.


<b>Get Involved</b>

With the high level goals of preserving our collective right as humans to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute to the cause.
