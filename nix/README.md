# Description

This folder contains configuration for [Nix](https://nixos.org/), a purely functional package manager used by the Status app for its build process.

# Configuration

The main config file is [`nix/nix.conf`](/nix/nix.conf) and its main purpose is defining the [binary caches](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-basic-package-mgmt) which allow download of packages to avoid having to compile them yourself locally.

__NOTE:__ If you are in Asia you might want to move the `nix-cache-cn` to be first in order of `extra-substituters`. Removing `cache.nixos.org` could also help.

# Shell

In order to access an interactive Nix shell a user should run `make shell`.

The Nix shell is started in this repo via the [`nix/shell.sh`](/nix/shell.sh) script, which is a wrapper around the `nix-shell` command and is intended for use with our main [`Makefile`](/Makefile). This allows for an implicit use of `nix-shell` as the default shell in the `Makefile`.

By default the shell starts without any specific target platform, if you want to change that you should export the `TARGET_OS` env variable with the right value:

```bash
TARGET_OS=android make shell
```
This way your shell and all other nix commands should run in a setup that is tailored towards Android development.

For valid values you can check the [`nix/platform.nix`](/nix/platform.nix) file.
