## Status

Proposed

## Context:

In order to try out vertical team, which is a structure that is wanted by the company, we will be creating a wallet team within the mobile team.
Some member of the mobile team will join the current wallet team, which is composed by developers from desktop and lead by @alaibe, on a voluntary basis.
The responsibilities of the team are to implement the new wallet UI, with the support of the current wallet team, which will be assisting with the status-go work.

## Decision

Some team members have already expressed interest and some have been asked and accepted to join the wallet team, these team members are:

- @rasom
- @OmarBasem
- @vkjr
- @J-Son89
- @briansztamfater
- @smohamedjavid
- @ulisesmac

# Follow-up Actions

- We still need 3/4 team members to join the wallet team
