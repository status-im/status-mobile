## Status

Proposed/partially implemented

## Context:

Currently, there is only a single team lead in the mobile development team, and after a meeting with the design team, it has been identified that the mobile app lacks polishness. One of the main issues identified is a lack of oversight in certain areas. To address this problem, it has been decided to create an additional role within the team. For each section of the mobile app (communities, syncing & onboarding, activity center & shell, wallet, messaging), a person will be selected to fulfill the responsibilities outlined below.

## Decision

The decision is to create an additional role within the mobile development team for each section. The individuals selected for these roles will have the following responsibilities:

- Ensure GitHub issues are created for new features/designs of the section.
- Ensure issues are adequately described and linked as best as possible.
- Ensure issues have a grooming session where other developers can provide their feedback before working on the set of issues.
- Ensure all relevant parties are invited, such as designers, QA, Product Owner, leads, etc., as needed (including the designer who created the feature).
- Ensure there is consensus among the developers working on the section about the decided strategy approach. Ideally, this consensus should be documented.
- Ensure UI quality by organizing designer reviews and guaranteeing pixel perfection.
- Ensure overall implementation is satisfactory based on the predefined requirements.
- Ensure alignment between desktop, web, and mobile versions for the respective section in collaboration with the mobile developers and design team.
- Act as a point of contact for the design team with respect to the section.
- Ensure that someone goes through the designs once they are created with the respective designer.
- Assist the design team with technical feasibility analysis and address any product concerns.
- Facilitate the growth of the next team member into the role.

The people identified for each sections are as follow:

- Messaging @flexsurfer, followed by @alwx
- Syncing & Onboarding @siddarthkay
- Communities @ilmotta
- Activity Center & Shell @J-Son89, followed by @Parveshdhull
- Wallet (once the vertical team is created) @J-Son89, followed by @briansztamfater

This will be a rotating post, every 4 months it will go to the next in line.

The wallet team might have longer times for rotation, as stability might be more important. That's still to be decided.

# Follow-up Actions

- Find suitable next in line for Messaging, Onboarding, Communities
