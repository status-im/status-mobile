# Decisions

We record decisions. More context on why and how we do that can be found in [DR-0001](0001-record-decisions.md).

The remainder of this document is intended to document tooling around this process.

## Utilities to Write Decision Records

- `doc/decisions/templates/template.md` - contains a template for a decision record.
- When recording a decision follow the established file name format
  `XXXX-some-title.md` where XXXX is the ever increasing count of decisions
  we've made.
